# Enderpy

Enderpy is a autocompletion, static type checker & language server for python.

</div>

## Why Do I Need It?

it provides developers with faster autocomplete suggestions and the ability
to easily navigate to the definition and references of variables and functions
in their code.

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is providing instant feedback as you type.
[Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) proved that there is a value
in providing faster implementation of static checkers.
That's why I'm continuing this path.

This project aims to build the components needed to achieve the goal of
providing fast autocompletion and type checking, including:

- Python parser
- Python type checker
- Python language server protocol implementation
